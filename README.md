Hi. &nbsp;üëãüèΩ &nbsp;üëã &nbsp;**We are happy you are here.**&nbsp; üéâ&nbsp;üåü

<br>

**`exercism/Crystal`** is one of many programming language tracks on [exercism(dot)org][exercism-website].
This repo holds all the instructions, tests, code, & support files for Crystal _exercises_ currently under development or implemented & available for students.

üåü &nbsp;&nbsp;Track tooling (_test-runner and Continuous Integration_) runs on Crystal `1.9.2`. <br>
üåü &nbsp;&nbsp;Most exercises are solvable with Crystal `1.0.0` or higher.

This track is made up of **Practice Exercises**. Practice exercises are open-ended, and can be used to practice concepts learned, try out new techniques, and play.
