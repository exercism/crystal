## Learning Crystal

* [Crystal Official Docs](https://crystal-lang.org/docs/): This is the go-tolearning resource for Crystal at the moment. And they are pretty exhaustive, right from the basic literals and variables to some advanced stuff like macros. They also have a neat [doc on coding conventions](https://crystal-lang.org/docs/conventions/index.html).

* Crystal Playground - While Crystal doesn't have a REPL (like Ruby, Python or Node), it does have a way to somewhat easily experiment with code. Just run `crystal play` and you should have a place to play around with Crystal in your browser at localhost:8080.

* [Crystal for Rubyists](http://www.crystalforrubyists.com/): A practical intro to Crystal language.
