# Bools

Crystal has a type know as [`Bool`][bools], it is used to represent the values `true` and `false`.
You can use logical operators (`!`, `||`, `&&`) which can be used to combine Bools and create more complex expressions:

```crystal
true && true
# => true

false || true
# => true

!false
# => true
```
