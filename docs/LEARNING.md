# Learning Crystal

- [Crystal Official Docs][offical-doc]: This is the go-to learning resource for Crystal at the moment. And they are pretty exhaustive, right from the basic literals and variables to some advanced stuff like macros. They also have a neat [doc on coding conventions][coding conventions].

- [Crystal for Rubyists][rubyists guide]: A practical intro to Crystal language.

- Crystal Playground - While Crystal doesn't have a built-in REPL (like Ruby, Python or Node), it does have a way to somewhat easily experiment with code. Just run `crystal play` and you should have a place to play around with Crystal in your browser at localhost:8080.

- [online editor][online editor] - A web-based REPL for Crystal, it is good place to get a feel of the language. 
  Without having to install anything.

- Crystal REPL Add-on - A GitHub user has created a REPL of sorts for Crystal. It's called [ICR][icr] (a nod to Ruby's IRB). As most things in Crystal, it's still in a nascent phase and might be prone to bugs.
