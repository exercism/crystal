# Crystal [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/exercism/crystal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/exercism/crystal)

Exercism problems in Crystal.

## The Tests

### All Exercises

Run all Exercises with:
```bash
$ make test-exercises
```

### Single Exercises

Run single Exercises with:
```bash
$ make test-exercise EXERCISE=exercise-name
```

## The Test Generator

### Creating a New Generator

Navigate to `generator/src/generators` and create a new generator file (i.e. `hello_world.cr`).

This file should contain 2 classes:
* An exercise generator which must inherit from the ExerciseGenerator class.
* A test case class which inherits from ExerciseTestCase.

There are two ways for the generator to get the test data.

**Local:**
The problem-specifications repo must reside at the same level as the developer's crystal directory, and must contain a canonical-data.json file for the given exercise.

**Remote:**
If the local problem-specifications repo doesn't exist, a request is made to GitHub to download (and cache) the test's canonical-data.json file.

### Running the Generator for a Single Exercise

From within the crystal directory:
```bash
$ crystal generator/generator.cr hello-world
```

Or build a binary and use that:
```bash
$ make build-generator
$ make generate-exercise GENERATOR=hello-world
```

### Running (or Re-running) the Generator for All Exercises

This can be used for refreshing the tests when changes are made to the x-common repo. Or for testing the full functionality of the test generator.

```bash
$ make generate-exercises
```

### Testing the Generator

```bash
$ make test-generator
```
