## Adding methods to the Array class

This exercise focuses on adding methods to the `Array` class in Crystal.
To do this you will have to define a class with the name `Array(T)`.
And put the methods inside this class.

```crystal
class Array(T)
  # your solution here
end
```

The array class is a [generic][] class, it is also [indexable][] and [enumerable][].
The source code for the `Array` class can be found [here][array].
