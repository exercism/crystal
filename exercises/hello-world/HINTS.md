## Project Structure

The Crystal exercises on exercism are setup to work with `crystal spec` (Crystal's default testing framework).

You will find two directories in each Crystal exercise: `src` and `spec`.

In `spec/hello_world_spec.cr`, the tests are defined. These are the goals you'll be working towards.

In `src`, you'll create a new file called `src/hello_world.cr` and define a new class or module for `HelloWorld`. There you'll work on adding in functionality to the class to make the tests pass.

## Submitting Your Solution

Once satisfied with your solution, you can submit your code by running `exercism submit src/hello_world.cr`.

Have fun!
