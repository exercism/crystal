# Installation

Crystal is available on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

What to note is that Crystal's windows support is experimental.
Thereby, it is not recommended to use it in production since issues may occur.
Instead for windows development, it is recommended to use [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)][wsl].
It is a **free** feature of windows 10(1903+) and 11 which allows developer to run a linux environment without the need of a virtual machine.

Use one of the [installation guides][installation guides] for instructions on installing Crystal.
