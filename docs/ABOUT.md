# About

Crystal is a compiled, object-oriented programming language.
These are some of the language's goals:

- Ruby-inspired syntax.

- Statically type-checked but without having to specify the type of variables or method arguments.

- Be able to call C code by writing bindings to it in Crystal.

- Have compile-time evaluation and generation of code, to avoid boilerplate code.

- Compile to efficient native code.
