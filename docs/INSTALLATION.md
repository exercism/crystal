# Installation

Crystal is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

What to note is that Crystal's windows support is experimental.
Thereby, it is not recommended to use it in production since issues may occur.
Instead for windows development, it is recommended to use [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)][wsl].

Use one of the [installation guides][installation guides] for instructions on installing Crystal.
