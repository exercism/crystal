Your friend Johannes loves doing diy (do it yourself) hardware.
They just built a juicer, Johannes is very excited about it.
Johannes goal is to be able to make fresh juice every morning.

Johannes Juice maker has a lot of fancy features.
Like a built in measurement system, which can tell you how much juice is in the cup.
It also has a timer, which can tell you how long the machine has been running.

Johannes isnt the best at programming, but they want to make a program to control the machine.
They have thereby asked you to help them.
