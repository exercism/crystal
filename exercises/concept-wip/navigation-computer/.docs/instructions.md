## 1. Navigation constants

The navigation computer needs to know the distance between some objects in space to do the right calculations, the distance is measured in km.
Km stands for kilometer, which is a unit of length, there kilo means 1000 and meter is a unit of length.
The distance should be from earth.
The distance that needs to be stored are neptune, mars and the atmosphere.

Define the following constants:

  - `NEPTUNE_DISTANCE` with the value `4 400 000 000` which should be stored as a `int64`
  - `MARS_DISTANCE` with the value `227_940_000` which should be stored as a `int32`
  - `ATMOSPHERE_DISTANCE` with the value `10_000` which should be stored as a `int16`
