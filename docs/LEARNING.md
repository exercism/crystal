## Learning Crystal

* [Crystal Official Docs](https://crystal-lang.org/docs/): This is the go-to
  learning resource for Crystal at the moment.
  And they are pretty exhaustive, right from the basic literals and variables to
  some advanced stuff like macros. They also have a neat
  [doc on coding conventions](https://crystal-lang.org/docs/conventions/index.html).

* [Crystal for Rubyists](http://www.crystalforrubyists.com/): A practical intro to Crystal language.
