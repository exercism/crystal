# Basics

## Getting Started

### Variables

To declare a [variable][variables], you must use the `=` assignment operator.
In Crystal variables should be written in [snake_case][snake-case].

```crystal
number = 1
puts number # => 1

number = 2
puts number # => 2
```

### Constants

[Constants][constants] are declared using the same `=` assignment operator, but use all uppercase letters, also known as SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.

```crystal
NUMBER = 1
puts NUMBER # => 1
```

Assigning a value to a constant that is already defined will result in a compile-time error.

```crystal
NUMBER = 1

NUMBER = 2
# Error: already initialized constant NUMBER
```

### Types

Crystal is a compiled language, which means that every variable or method argument is assigned a type at compile time.
The compiler is capable of inferring the type of a variable or method argument.
Although in some cases it is necessary to specify the type.
The cases that requires a type to be set will be explained in later concepts.

### Methods

[Methods][methods] are a way to group together a set of instructions that can be reused.
In Crystal methods are often defined in a class, module or struct.
But methods can also be defined outside of a class, module or struct.
Methods are declared using the `def` keyword, followed by the name of the method.
In Crystal methods should be written in snake_case.
When a method doesn't have any arguments, you can omit the parentheses.
To declare the end of a method, you must use the `end` keyword.

```crystal
def hello
  puts "Hello World!"
end
```

Using a method that doesn't exist on the type of the variable or method argument will result in a compile-time error.

```crystal
number = 1
number + "1"
```

```console
In test.cr:2:7

 2 | number + "1"
           ^
Error: no overload matches 'Int32#+' with type String
```

### Arguments

Methods can have [arguments][arguments].
Arguments are data that is passed to a method.
To be able to give a method arguments, you must specify the name of the argument.
In Crystal arguments should be written in snake_case.
A method can have multiple arguments, but the arguments must be separated by a comma.

```crystal
def hello(name)
  puts "Hello #{name}!"
end
```

Methods can also have multiple arguments.
In this case, the arguments must be separated by a comma.

```crystal
def hello(name, language)
  puts "Hello #{name}! You are learning #{language}."
end
```

### Calling Methods

When calling a method that belongs to a class, module or struct, you must use the dot operator(`.`).
Like following: `<ClassName>.<method_name>`.
When the method doesn't belong to a class, module or struct, then you can simply call it by writing its name.
Methods always implicitly return the value of the last expression in the method.

When a method has arguments, you may use parentheses when specifying the arguments in the method call and definition, like following: `<method_name>(<argument_1>, <argument_2>)`.
When a method has no arguments, parentheses should be omitted.

```crystal
def hello(name)
  "Hello #{name}!"
end

hello("Crystal")
# => Hello Crystal!
```

When calling a method with multiple arguments, the arguments should be separated by a comma.
The arguments must be given in the same order as the method arguments.

```crystal
def hello_language(name, language)
  puts "Hello #{name}! You are learning #{language}."
end

hello_language("World", "Crystal")
# => Hello World! You are learning Crystal.
```

Calling a method with the wrong number of arguments will result in a compile-time error.

```crystal
hello_language("Crystal")
```

```console
In test.cr:1:1

 1 | hello_language("Crystal")
     ^----
Error: wrong number of arguments for 'hello_language' (given 1, expected 2)
```

### Addition & Subtraction & Multiplication

In Crystal, you can use the `+` operator to add two numbers together.
You can also use the `-` operator to subtract two numbers.
And you can use the `*` operator to multiply two numbers.

```crystal
1 + 1
# => 2

2 - 1
# => 1

2 * 2
# => 4
```

### Comments

In Crystal [comments][comments] are written with the `#` character, followed by a space and then the comment.
Comments are used to document code.
Comments are not executed by the compiler.

```crystal
# This is a comment
```
