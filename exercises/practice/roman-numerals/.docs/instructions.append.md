## Adding method to the Int struct

This exercise focuses on adding methods to the `Int` struct in Crystal.
To do this you will have to define a struct with the name `Int`.
And put the method inside this struct.

```crystal
struct Int
  # your solution here
end
```

The source code for the `Int` class can be found [here][int].
