# Basics

Crystal is a compiled, object-oriented programming language. These are some of the language's goals:

- Ruby-inspired syntax.

- Statically type-checked but without having to specify the type of variables or method arguments.

- Be able to call C code by writing bindings to it in Crystal.

- Have compile-time evaluation and generation of code, to avoid boilerplate code.

- Compile to efficient native code.

In 2011 did the work on crystal start with the goal of creating a language with the elegance and productivity of Ruby, but with the performance and type safety of a compiled language.
Originaly
The language was developed and designed by Ary Borenszweig, Juan Wajnerman, Brian Cardif.
