# Exercism Crystal Track

[![Build Status](https://github.com/exercism/crystal/workflows/Tests/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/exercism/crystal/actions?query=workflow%3ATests+branch%3Amain)

Exercism problems in Crystal.

## The Tests

### All Exercises

Test all exercises with:
```bash
$ make test-exercises
```

### Single Exercises

Test single exercises with:
```bash
$ make test-exercise EXERCISE=exercise-name
```

## The Test Generator

### Creating a New Generator

Navigate to `generator/src/generators` and create a new generator file (i.e. `hello_world.cr`).

This file should contain 2 classes:
* An exercise generator which must inherit from the ExerciseGenerator class.
* A test case class which inherits from ExerciseTestCase.

There are two ways for the generator to get the test data.

**Local:**
The problem-specifications repo must reside at the same level as the developer's crystal directory, and must contain a canonical-data.json file for the given exercise.

**Remote:**
If the local problem-specifications repo doesn't exist, a request is made to GitHub to download (and cache) the test's canonical-data.json file.

### Running the Generator for a Single Exercise

From within the crystal directory:
```bash
$ crystal generator/generator.cr hello-world
```

Or build a binary and use that:
```bash
$ make generate-exercise GENERATOR=hello-world
```

NOTE: A binary version of the generator is built automatically when needed for a given make target, but you may build it manually at any time by running `make build-generator` (or rebuild it with `make clean build-generator`).

### Running (or Re-running) the Generator for All Exercises

This can be used for refreshing the tests when changes are made to the [problem-specifications](https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications) repo. Or for testing the full functionality of the test generator.

```bash
$ make generate-exercises
```

### Testing the Generator

```bash
$ make test-generator
```

### Cleaning up

```bash
$ make clean
```

Use this command to delete any transient files and build artifacts. This is potentially useful for troubleshooting purposes as it will purge any stale cached files, rebuild the generator when needed and can be combined with other make targets (e.g. `make clean test`).
