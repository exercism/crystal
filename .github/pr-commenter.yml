      On the Crystal-lang repo we use a doc generator to generate all introduction.md files. The tool is located in the document-generator folder. Our tooling has noticed that they are out of sync of the about.md file, this can be caused of 2 reasons:
      
      1. You have updated an introduction.md file instead of updating the concepts about.md file
      2. You have updated the about.md file but haven't synced.
